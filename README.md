## Learn the fundamentals for building a full-fledged fullstack React application

This is the repo for the course by [Codemochi](https://codemochi.com) called [End to End React with Prisma 2](https://courses.codemochi.com/end-to-end-react-with-prisma-2). We will cover all of the techniques needed to build a fully fledged app- user login, permissions, database management, backend creation. The works!

We will build an entire social RSS reader full stack application from scratch over 10 hours and learn all of the fundamentals of building a professional grade app.

### Overview

Check out the `master` branch to see a step by step guide for building this application from the ground up. Each step is a commit which makes it easy to tell exactly what changed from step to step.

If you just want the finished product, you can clone this repo and the `mater` branch will have the finished version if you pull the latest.

### How to use this Project

If you just want to run the app, check out the latest on the `master` branch and then create a `.env` file in the root of your file. This `.env` has changed with the latest version of nextjs-auth0 package, so I include the lower block so you can see how the variable names changed with the latest version of nextjs-auth0- you only need the top block of variables.

_.env_

```
# NEW ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/prisma?schema=public"
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=xxxx
AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL='https://yyyy.us.auth0.com'
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=zzzzz
AUTH0_SCOPE='openid profile'
AUTH0_SECRET='some-really-long-string-has-to-be-at-least-40-characters'
AUTH0_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# OLD ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES- DO NOT USE WITH STEP 33 OR LATER
#DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/prisma?schema=public"
#AUTH0_CLIENTID=xxxx
#AUTH0_DOMAIN=yyyy.us.auth0.com
#AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=zzzzz
#AUTH0_SCOPE='openid profile'
#AUTH0_COOKIE='some-really-long-string-has-to-be-at-least-40-characters'
#BACKEND_ADDRESS=http://localhost:3000
```

You can get the Auth0 credentials by following the video in step 3. The database will get set up in step 2 when we configure Prisma 2.

You can start the app locally by running `npm run dev`.
